# TFG-Fisica-2021
Study about quantum computing algorithms (in Spanish, at least to begin with). Small implementations of some of the algorithms included, such as Deutsch-Josza and Grover.

Please note this GitHub repository will be rebranded and tidied up (mainly creating directories). For the time being, you might want to browse directly to the following bunch of files: 

*  [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm implementation in Python](https://github.com/raulillo82/TFG-Fisica-2021/blob/main/d-j.py)
*  [Grover algorithm implementation in Python](https://github.com/raulillo82/TFG-Fisica-2021/blob/main/grover.py)
*  [Latex sources for Lyx of the documentation.](https://github.com/raulillo82/TFG-Fisica-2021/blob/main/memoria-TFG.lyx) (Spanish language)
*  [Documentation in PDF.](https://github.com/raulillo82/TFG-Fisica-2021/blob/main/memoria-TFG.pdf) (Spanish language)
