Deutsch-Josza algorithm solves a problem without a practical aim. However it does show quantum supremacy for SOME problems.
Given a function f(x), it will return either a constant or a balanced result.
Said otherwise, the function received a binary input and will output a binary output. The truth table of the function would be:

Contant cases: a) f(x) yields 0, no matter what the input is. b) f(x) yields 1, no matter what the input is
x f(x)  x f(x)
0  0    0  1
1  0    1  1

Balanced cases: c) f(x) yields x. d) f(x) yields the opposite of x ("not" x, in a classical circuit)
x f(x)  x f(x)
0  0    0  1
1  1    1  0

How many evalutations are needed to find out whether f(x) is balanced or constant?
The answer for the classical case is obvious, 2. It can be demonstrated that for n bits, the answer would be 2^n (all the possible combinations of n bits)
So the complexity would be O(2^n)

In order to evaluate the same problem with a quantum circuit (which is hopefully more efficient), we know all quantum gates need to be reversible (to be explained in the report)
Is f(x) reversible?? Unfortunately not.

This will be bypassed by using an oracle (blackbox). Our oracle will get two inputs (qubits) and yield two outputs (qubits).
Inputs will q1 and q0. Outputs will be q1 and (y xor x). If we apply that oracle twice, we get the inputs. So, the oracle is reversible.
XOR is a classical gate, but it does have its equivalent in the quantum world: CNOT gate.

The algorithm uses two of the three special properties of the quantum world: Superposition and Interference (the remaining one would be (Entanglement)
Steps:
    1: Use two qubits, x and y (or q0 and q1). Initial values are always 0 in quantum circuits.
    2: Invert y (or q1) to have a 1 value
    3: Apply H (Hadamard) gates to both qubits, to bring both qubits to a superposition state
    4: Apply the oracle
    5: Apply H gates again to both outputs (interference)
    6: Measure x (q0). 0 means constant, 1 means balanced

The oracle was applied only once (H gates are "cheap" computationally speaking). Actually, if this expanded to n bits, the Oracle would still only need one evaluation! We would still need 2n qubits to run the algorithm though.
So the complexity of the algorithm in general would be O(1).

Going from O(2^n) to O(1) is an exponential improvement.

Oracle definition. Remember f(x) is the function we want to evaluate, which will be either balanced or constant. There are two possibilites for each of the cases:
    a) Balanced case
    Input   Input   f(x)    (y xor f(x))    Input   Input   f(x)    (y xor f(x))
    x(q0)   y(q1)                           x(q0)   y(q1)              
     0       0       0          0            0       0       1          1
     0       1       0          1            0       1       1          0
     1       0       0          0            1       0       1          1
     1       1       0          1            1       1       1          0
            (y xor f(x))=y                          (y xor f(x))=not (y)

    b) Constant case
    Input   Input   f(x)    (y xor f(x))    Input   Input   f(x)    (y xor f(x))
    x(q0)   y(q1)                           x(q0)   y(q1)              
     0       0       0          0            0       0       1          1
     0       1       0          1            0       1       1          0
     1       0       1          1            1       0       0          0
     1       1       1          0            1       1       0          1
            (y xor f(x))=y XOR x                   (y xor f(x))=y XOR (not(x))
                CNOT of x and y                         CNOT of (not x) and y

As said, we went from a non-reversible function f(x) to our reversible oracle
